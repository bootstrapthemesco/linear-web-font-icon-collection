Awesome Web font Icon collection for your web project. 
=================

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.




##### Using Icon Fonts in your project
* 1. Copy the fonts folder

`packages/linear-webfont-collection/fonts`

* 2. Copy the css file

`packages/linear-webfont-collection/iconfont.css`

* 3. In the head html, reference the location to the css file

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/iconfont.css">`

* 4. Add classes to your elements

`<i class="icon icon-home"></i>`

=====================

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. See this guide for more info: https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts
